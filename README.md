📊Customer Spending Prediction using Linear Regression

This project analyzes and predicts customer spending behavior using a real-world dataset. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a Linear Regression model, we developed a predictive pipeline with strong performance metrics.

🔑Key Insights 

High spenders were older and had higher incomes.

Wine and meat products were the highest contributors to spending.

Store and catalog purchases were stronger predictors than web purchases.

📈Model Performance 

Validation/Test Set R² Score: 1.00

Train/Val/Test Score Consistency: R² ≈ 0.996

Test RMSE: 35.67

Test MAE: 23.69

🔍Residual Analysis 

The residuals show a minimal pattern, indicating that the model is fitting the data well and there is no significant bias or heteroscedasticity.
